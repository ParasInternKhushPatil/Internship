Here are the Five Problem solved using MATLAB, C++ and Python
1. Prove that two consecutive rotation (1st - α & 2nd- β) is equivalent to one single rotation by angle (α + β).
2. For what value of k, the vectors [2, 4, 1, k]T and [k, 2, 4, 5]T are orthogonal (T - Transpose)
3. For what value of k, the vectors [8, 4, 1, k]T and [2, −4, k, k]T are orthogonal?
4. Write the vector v = [1, −2, 5] as a linear combination of the vectors u1 = [1, 1, 1], u2 = [1, 2, 3],u3 = [2, −1, 1]
